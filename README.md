### [FastAPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/)
>FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3. It was created by Sebastián Ramírez in 2018 and has gained popularity due to its speed, simplicity, and ease of use. FastAPI is built on top of the Starlette framework and leverages the power of Python's type annotations to provide automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.

### [Starlette](https://pypi.org/project/starlette/)
>Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services. It's a great choice for building GraphQL servers, monitoring tools, or any other ASGI based application.

### [Uvicorn](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/)
>Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools. It's the standard ASGI server recommended to use with Starlette and FastAPI.

### [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
>Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables. It is a simple way to configure your application without having to change environment variables directly.
